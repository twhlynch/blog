This guide targets modding Meta Quest games, and is from my old github repository for it.

### Requirements

- [sidequest](https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto) (for sideloading after modding)
- [Apktool](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/) added to PATH
- [zipalign and Apksigner (Command-line tools)](https://developer.android.com/studio#command-line-tools-only) added to PATH

### Setup

- Download an APK.
- Add the requirements to your PATH environment variable:

### Decompile the APK

```bash
apktool d -f [APK_NAME].apk
```

Use this command to decompile the APK into a folder called \[APK_NAME\]:

### Modify the APK

This is where you can make changes to the apk. The most basic way would be swapping out audio or texture assets.

You can also change the package name in order to install the APK separately to the unmodded version. To do this, open `apktool.yml` in a text editor and change the `renameManifestPackage` value to something else. (eg, `com.index.[APK_NAME]_modded`)

Note: Only use letters and underscores

### Recompile the APK

```bash
apktool b -f --use-aapt2 -d [APK_NAME]
```

This command will recompile the APK into `[APK_NAME]/dist/[APK_NAME].apk`:

### Create a keystore

> For now use the keys in /tools from the original repository (top of page)

### Traverse to the folder containing the APK

```bash
cd [APK_NAME]/dist
```

### Align the APK

```bash
zipalign -p 4 [APK_NAME] aligned-[APK_NAME]
```

This command will align the APK into `aligned-[APK_NAME].apk`:

### Sign the APK

```bash
ApkSigner sign --key index.pk8 --cert index.pem --v4-signing-enabled false --out modded-[APK_NAME].apk aligned-[APK_NAME].apk
```

This command will sign the APK

Ready to sideload! You will find the APK as `[APK_NAME]/dist/modded-[APK_NAME].apk`.
