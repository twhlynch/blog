## Creating compatible models

First of course you want to get yourself a model to use as your cosmetic. Open this in blender and we will come back to it.
For this example i will be using this 'Grabby bot' model as a custom checkpoint.

Go to https://github.com/uberpixel/SGM-file-format and download the repository with the green "Code" button as a ZIP.
Unzip it and locate SGM-file-format-master\BlenderExport\2_8x\io_export_sgm.py
In blender go to Edit>Preferences>Add-ons and click Install.

Enter the path to io_export_sgm.py and click Install Add-on.
Now go back to your model. Ensure it is joined and is the active object.
Click File>Export>Rayne Model (.sgm), name it, and then "Export Rayne Model".

Now you have your GRAB compatible model.

## Using custom models

Now that you have a .sgm file you are ready to use it in game.
Go to your Steam library and locate GRAB.
Click the cog (or right click on the game in the category list), Manage, Browse local files.
It should open an explorer window.
Navigate to GRAB\Resources\cosmetics or GRAB\Resources\models for default models.
From there find the file you are looking to replace.
For this example I find "GRAB\Resources\models\player\checkpoint.sgm".
Rename your custom model to match, so for me "checkpoint.sgm", and replace the file.
Now boot up the game and you should see your custom model!
