Browsing through my sites, using the projects I work on, and otherwise interacting with me online you will notice a certain character that appears more often than not.

This character, with the appearance of a black and cyan/white stick figure with bunny ears is known as idnex.

## Origin

idnex (lowercase i) is based off of my avatar in [GRAB](https://grabvr.quest). Some time in 2024 JeffBobDude invited me to join a lobby he was hosting, and I joined to find a small group going nuts over a goofy stick figure version of myself.

I posed with idnex and thought that would be that, but over time idnex would get largely adopted not just as a silly character that myself and others would place in maps, but as memes, fanart, my discord bot, and eventually my logo.

## My logo

If it wasn't already obvious, the favicon to this site is idnex's head. I traced it over some fanart I/idnex was given by Eclipse; one of the GRAB moderators. the art depicted me as Alastor from Hazbin Hotel, with idnex as a cane. I traced over the head of the staff to create an svg I would go on to use as a logo for everything I do.

## Fanart

I use fanart of idnex for the thumbnails on this blog. As of writing this, idnex has received over 300 pieces of art, including many animations. Here are some of my favourites.

## Trap

A friend of mine from GRAB; Trap11190 has made it his sole purpose in life to cause as much suffering to idnex as possible, and humorously, many have followed. idnex is usually added to GRAB's lobbies (community built) being crushed by boulders, or set on fire.

## Meta

I will expand on this post in the future.
