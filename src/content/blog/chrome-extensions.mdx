## Downloading the extension
For this guide we are assuming the extension is on GitHub.
For other situations, just figure out how to download the extension as a zip file.

1. Go to the GitHub page of the extension.
2. Click the green "Code" button. (You may need to zoom out or fullscreen the window to see it)

3. Click "Download ZIP".
4. Extract the zip file to a folder on your computer.
5. Ideally, move the folder somewhere out of your downloads folder, but thats up to you.

## Installing the extension
1. Open Chrome, or any Chromium based browser.
2. Go to the extensions page by clicking the three dots in the top right corner, then "More tools", then "Extensions".
3. If you haven't already, enable developer mode by enabling the toggle in the top right corner.
4. Click "Load unpacked" in the top left.

5. Find the folder you extracted the extension to, and navigate to the folder that contains a file called `manifest.json`.
6. Click "Select", "Select Folder", or "Open" (depending on your OS).
7. The extension should now be installed, and you can use it like any other extension.
